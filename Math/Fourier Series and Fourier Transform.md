#### Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

- So long as the two since waves have the same frequency, their sum will always be another sine wave of exact same frequency, but with a different amplitude and phase
- if the sine waves of different frequencies add together, then the result waveform is no longer a sine wave
- Every possible waveform and function in existence can be generated by just add together different sets of sine waves
- Non-repeating waveforms can also be generated by adding sine waves together, in these case, sine waves of every possible frequency may be needed
